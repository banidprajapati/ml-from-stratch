# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy. Each section includes notes explaining the underlying mathematics and intuition.

## Categories
- [ ] Linear & Logistic Regression
- [ ] Neural Networks (with backpropagation)
- [ ] Clustering (e.g., K-Means)
- [ ] Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods
- [ ] SVMs
- [ ] Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)

## Goals
- Reinforce theoretical understanding through code
- Keep notes for future reference and revision
